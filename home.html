    <h1>Scoutmaster's Minute</h1>  
    <p>
    Welcome to Troop 374, an active Troop within the North Start District of the Occoneechee Council! 
    We serve the youth of Raleigh and surrounding areas and are chartered by Saint Andrews Presbyterian Church. 
    We have patrols for boys starting at 6th grade. We have an incredible volunteer staff dedicated to serving and 
    preparing our youth to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values 
    of the Scout Oath and Law. We believe that every child deserves a well-trained leader, and our leaders have
    extensive training to ensure that our youth have the best experience possible.
    </p>
    <p>
    Thereâ€™s never been a more exciting time to be a part of our Scouting family, and we invite you to join us
    for fun and adventure! We meet most Tuesdays at 7:00pm at Saint Andrews Presbyterian Church. 
    We hope to see you soon!
    </p>

    Scout Me In!
