    <h1>Scoutmaster's Minute {{ randomNumber }}</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to Troop 374!
    </p>        
    <p>
        Scouting is more than a collection of badges, uniforms, and camping trips—it's a journey of adventure, leadership, and responsibility. In our troop, we strive to cultivate an environment where each Scout can grow into a confident leader, a conscientious citizen, and a resilient individual.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our Scouts embark on thrilling adventures, from hiking in the wilderness to navigating rivers. Every challenge faced and every trail conquered molds our Scouts into brave, resourceful individuals.
        Scouting provides endless opportunities to develop leadership skills. Whether planning a community service project or leading a patrol on a hike, our Scouts learn the true essence of leadership—supporting others, making decisions, and taking responsibility for their actions.
    </p>         
    <p>
        With every expectation of a position of responsibility met and and every obstacle negotiated, our Scouts learn the importance of responsibility. They understand the value of their commitments to themselves, their troop, and their community. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Join us on this incredible journey. Together, we will explore, grow, and lead with integrity and courage. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Yours in Scouting,
    <p>
